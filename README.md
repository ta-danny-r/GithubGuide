<h2>  A few tips </h2>
<h2>  Before pushing files on Github. 
      Please make sure that your are on the current directory of your project in the command line / terminal.
      You can navigate to your current project on the command line / terminal using <b> cd </b>
</h2>

<h2>
  Here is an example
  If my project is in <b> Desktop </b> inside a folder called <b> Code </b>
  
  I will type this in my command line / terminal
  
  <b> cd Desktop </b>
  After I will type
  <b> cd Code  </b>
  Now I can use git commands. Like this.
  <b> git add . </b>
  <b> git commit -m "Enter your message here" </b>
  <b> git push </b>
</h2>
