<p> <i> GitCommands.txt </i> contains a file that explains the Git commands to use on the command line / terminal. </p>

<p>  A few tips </p>
<p>  Before pushing files on Github. 
      Please make sure that your are on the current directory of your project in the command line / terminal.
      You can navigate to your current project on the command line / terminal using <b> cd </b>
<p>

<p>
  Here is an example <br>
      If my project is in <b> <i> Desktop </i> </b> inside a folder called <b> </i> Code  </i> </b>
  
  I will type this in my command line / terminal <br>
  
  <b> cd Desktop </b> <br>
  After I will type <br>
  <b> cd Code  </b> <br>
  Now I can use git commands. Like this. <br>
  <b> git add . </b> <br>
  <b> git commit -m "Enter your message here" </b> <br>
  <b> git push </b> <br>
</p>
